# Portfolio-Scripts
A collection of my scripts from a few different C# projects I've worked on.
ComboTarget, FPSCameraController, PlayerCombatController, and PlayerMovementController are scripts from my my college capstone project
Fallen Night. It was a firstperson action game with its combat focused on directional combat. Some gameplay for this project can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejZnQarzQoQ

WeaponBase is an example of a Decorator Pattern that I wrote for a side project I was working on.
